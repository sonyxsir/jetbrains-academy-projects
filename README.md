# jetbrains-academy-projects

Here will be placed a few projects made for JetBrains Academy / Python developer course.

List of projects completed:

1. Zookeaper.
  This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.
2. Coffee Machine.
  What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
