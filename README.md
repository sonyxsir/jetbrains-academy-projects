# jetbrains-academy-projects

Here will be placed a few projects made for JetBrains Academy / Python developer course.

List of projects completed:

1. <b>Zookeaper</b>.
  This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.
2. <b>Coffee Machine</b>.
  What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
3. <b>Credit calculator</b>.
  Finance is an important part of the life of any people. Sometimes you think about getting additional income and want to open a deposit account. And sometimes you need additional money right now and want to take a credit or mortgage. Anyway, you may want to calculate different financial indicators to make a decision. Let’s make such an instrument that can help us.
4. <b>Simple Chatty Bot</b>.
  Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!
5. <b>Hangman</b>.
  Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!
6. <b>Tic-Tac-Toe</b>.
  Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
